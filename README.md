very simple peak mod that reconnects to the last lobby you were in on keypress

# Uses lobby join codes to reconnect, so make sure your friends have "lobby mode" set to "open to friends" in their general settings
you can't share a join code without this setting enabled, if you joined a lobby through a steam invite link, you're good to go already

if you don't join back in a couple seconds after pressing your kebind, the lobby might be gone, or you can try pressing the button again

you can configure the keybind to reconnect in the config, and the lobby code for the last room you were in is also saved there
changing binds will require a game restart, same if you want to manually put in a lobby code for whatever reason

I didn't test controller binds but they should probably work.

feel free to modify, rip, / do whatever
